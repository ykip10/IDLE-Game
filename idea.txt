Ideas to implement:
PVE:
    PVE spend gold on gear to fight mobs
    have two modes of combat attack and defense, time click in the small window to
    hit. parry unlocked later on with a small base chance on perfect combat score 
    but base chance can be upgraded with resource 
    

Generators:
    - add cost multiplier for upgrades range(1.07x - 1.15x is industry standard)
    - every 100 purchases of a generator = adds a multiplier to the base production

Resource

Game Mechanics:
    - new Game+ Feature (new resource that can be spent for permanent upgrades, faster early game)
    introduce it shortly after when hit first plateau
    - Achievements - increase production of building, click rate and other buffs ex on new game+, start with 1000 money
    - Other ugprades availiable to purchase with gold 
    - settings menu
    - save file
    - offline increase, 0.1-0.2x produduction of resources while offline
    - u cant start a new run
    like u can only unlock that feature once u get all the buildings
    so u have to fight that mob
    and u can only fight that mob by accumulating pve xp through active play
    and if u dont start now its gonna take ages
